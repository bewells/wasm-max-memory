        <h1>How much WASM memory do I have?</h1>
        <p>
            WebAssembly uses 32-bit addresses for its linear memory.
            In theory, this means that the maximum memory size for a
            WebAssembly module would be 2^32 bytes or 4 GiB.
        </p>
        <p>
            In practice, maximum memory size is limited by a number
            of environment-specific factors such as available
            host memory or browser implementation issues. Click
            the button below to find out how much memory is
            available on your machine.
        </p>

            Warning: Calculating maximum memory involves attempting to
            allocate the maximum amount. This could place undue stress
            on your device. Click at your own risk.
